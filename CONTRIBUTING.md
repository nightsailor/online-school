## Submitting Contributionsüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

This project requires the following tools:
 * Javascript - The programming language used by Node Js.
 * NPM or yarn - Tools used for managing libraries.

To get started, install Node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local computer if you don't have already.

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

**Step 0 : Find an issue**

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

**Step 1. Fork the repository from [here](https://github.com/nightsailor/online-school/fork).**

![fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nightsailor/online-school/main/demo/fork.png)

**Step 2. Clone the forked repository into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/online-school.git
$ cd online-school
```
> Note : Replace `<your-username>` with your own username in the above command.

- Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote. 
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/nightsailor/online-school
    ```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
    ```bash
    git remote update
    git checkout main
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```  

**Step 3. Install the project dependencies**

We need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `package.json`

- Using npm :
    ```bash
    $ cd server && npm install
    $ cd ../client && npm install
    ```

- Using yarn : 
    ```bash
    $ cd server && yarn install
    $ cd ../client && yarn install
    ```


Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
  $ cd server && npm start
  $ cd ../client && yarn start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.


**Step 6 : Work on the issue assigned**

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

    ```bash  
    # To add all new files to your branch
    git add .  

    # To add only a few files to Branch_Name
    git add <some files>
    ```

**Step 7 : Commit**

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

    ```bash
    # This message get associated with all files you have changed  
    git commit -m "message"  
    ```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

**Step 8 : Work Remotely**

- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

    ```bash  
    # To push your work to your remote repository
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```

**Step 9 : Pull Request**

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.ü•≥
